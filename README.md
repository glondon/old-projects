Old Projects
========================

Some old projects that unfortunately got discontinued for whatever the reason. 

<b>captcha</b> - A simple form with a captcha I was doing testing on. Not much else to it. 

<b>signup-forum</b> - Used to be located at SignUpAndMakeMoney.com/forum, but I decided to take the forum down due to not really seeing the need to have it anymore. It was a Simple Machines Forum which I modified the theme template to match the current look of the website. 

<b>southvirginiahomes</b> - A website I built for a friend of mine when he was first starting out as a real estate agent. I built the website using Zend Framework. About a year later he decided not to keep the domain name active and that was the end of that.
